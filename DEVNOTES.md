# The case for a "Asset identity & information access" layer

- alerts.py uses the models to access the right `price_history` function depending on
  the asset type. -> Need some abstraction layer there? Something better than
  `api.ticker` today?
- Tickerconfig: I used in both finalerts and fignal. 
  - What should this be in the future? Something central somewhere?
  - Also add crypto to it? (Including the coingecko symbols?)
  - Or would this be some kind of generic price access layer that contains everything in
    the `api` folder as well as the tickerconfig?
  - Could also take care of other stuff: SearchObj, rate limiting detection / caching /
    sleeping, aux functions to search for tickers etc.
  - Tickerconfig would have to be extensible. Would have just the minimum information
    required to uniquely identify an asset but would be lenient enough to allow storing
    of arbitrary additional attributes like `strategy` or `comments` that can be used in
    "higher levels" such as Fignal.
- Would this also include the base classes Asset, PublicEquityAsset, CryptoAsset, etc.?

# Other dependencies

- What about MetricHistory? -- I guess this is part of alerts? Or should this be another
  separate package? If so, why? -- Or should the whole thing be a library and alerts,
  ticker, metric history etc. be packages within it? -- Would MetricHistory be a
  glorified / persistent cache for tessa?
